## Damn Vulnerable Defi Challenge - Brownie Edition

**Welcome to the Brownie edition of the "damn vulnerable defi challenge"! In this repository, you will find my solutions to the challenges using the power of Python and the amazing Brownie framework.**

## Requirements
To run the solutions, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher and Brownie installed on your system.\
You can install Brownie by running the following command:\
```pipx install eth-brownie```

## Challenges
The challenges are organized into different folders within the `test` folder, each one containing a  script with the solution.\
To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding folder and run the following command: \
```brownie test tests/{name_of_folder}/test_{name_of_script}.py -s --disable-warnings```

Example;\
```brownie test tests/unstoppable/test_unstoppable.py -s --disable-warnings```


I hope you have as much fun solving these challenges as I did! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Good luck!
